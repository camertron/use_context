## weft

![Unit Tests](https://github.com/camertron/weft/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

weft /w…õft/ noun: The horizontal threads that are interlaced through the warp in a woven fabric.

## What is this thing?

Weft is a tool for providing block-level context to Ruby programs in a thread-safe and fiber-safe way. Internally it leverages thread- or fiber-local storage. It can be used to provide data, etc to parts of your program that might be difficult or inconvenient to reach with eg. normal argument passing.

Weft was inspired by this use-case, and originally proposed as an addition to ViewComponent: https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/discussions/2327

## Usage

There are three ways to use weft. As some folks are understandably uncomfortable using monkeypatches - especially ones applied to core classes and modules - you are free to choose the one that fits your preferences.

### As a monkeypatch

Add the following to your program or application somewhere:

```ruby
require "weft/ext/kernel"
```

This will add two methods to `Kernel` so they are available everywhere: `provide_context`, and `use_context`. Contexts consist of a name and a hash of key/value pairs.

```ruby
def speak
  use_context(:welcome) do |context|
    puts context[:salutation]
  end
end

provide_context(:welcome, { salutation: "Hello, world!" }) do
  speak  # prints "Hello, world!"
end
```

Values are available in the current context only for the duration of the block passed to `provide_context`, and reset after the block returns.

### As a refinement

Add the following to your program or application somewhere:

```ruby
require "weft/ext/kernel_refinement"
```

The refinement can be enabled at the class, module, or file level, and adds the same two methods to `Kernel`. Refinements work differently than monkeypatching in that their changes are not globally applied and are only visible within the scope they are enabled in.

```ruby
# Makes provide_context and use_context available on Kernel, but only within this file
using Weft::KernelRefinement

provide_context(:welcome, { salutation: "Hello, world!" }) do
  ...
end
```

### No magic

If you'd rather avoid modifying `Kernel` altogether, weft can also be used via the `Weft` constant.

Add the following to your program or application somewhere:

```ruby
require "weft"
```

Then simply call `Weft.provide_context` and `Weft.use_context`:

```ruby
Weft.provide_context(:welcome, { salutation: "Hello, world!" }) do
  Weft.use_context(:welcome) do |context|
    puts context[:salutation]  # prints "Hello, world!"
  end
end
```

## Overriding context

If a key already exists in the current context, it will be overridden, but only for the duration of the block:

```ruby
provide_context(:welcome, { salutation: "Hello, world!" }) do
  provide_context(:welcome, { salutation: "Hola, mundo!" }) do
    speak  # prints "Hola, mundo!"
  end

  speak  # prints "Hello, world!"
end
```

## Running Tests

`bundle exec rake` should do the trick.
